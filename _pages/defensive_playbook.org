#+Options: toc:nil

#+Options: H:5

* General principles
  * Do not disc watch! Check periodically on the disc, but focus on the
    thrower's targets.
  * No loafing! If the player you are covering is nowhere useful (such as far
    behind the disc) do not stand around and do nothing. Find a place to make
    life difficult for the offense.

* Zone defenses

** 3-3-1

**** Clip (Mark): Terminology and positions
     - Zones and lanes covered by each of these positions.
     - Cup:
       + "On point" is the designated marker
       + "Off point"
       + "Top" of the cup
     - "Wings"
     - "Short deep"
     - "Monster" or "deep deep"
**** Clip (Mark): Cup movement
     - Force is towards one sideline.
     - Basic positioning moving from one side to center to other side.
     - Sideline trap within ~5 yards of sideline
     - Cup should not be too tight: Off point and Top ~5 yards from thrower
     - Better to run smart than to run fast.
**** Clip (Mark): Short deep, wings and monster
     - Short deep communicates with the Top
     - Shifting the Top, but not exposing the huck
     - Do not enter the cup
     - Do not focus on the disc, watch for cutters
     - Wings can pinch
     - Monster directs the whole backfield  
**** Clip (Mark): Defending against crashers
     - Crashers through the cup gaps should be called by the short deep.
     - Top is primarily responsible to step in with the crasher
     - Off point watches for crashers coming from under the cup and
       steps in to stop those throws.
     - Lots of crashers means the thrower can't find a way around the cup: good!
     - Can't stop every crasher, but make it uncomfortable for the thrower.
**** Future clip: 3-2-2 variant
     - Short deep drops back so now there is a left deep and right deep.
     - Wings pinch in cover the gap on either side of the Top
     - Top plays more centrally between the two points without shading
     - On a swing the deep on that side comes in for long up line throws
       while the wing looks to cut off shorter up line throws. Top does not
       over pursue to stop throw back into the middle of the field.
     - 3-2-2 can be useful in a couple of situations
       1. Offense is successfully attacking the gaps in the cup.
       2. Offense is near the endzone and there is less need to defend
	  deep throws.
** 2-3-2
   Put this zone off until possibly later in the season.
**** Terminology & positioning
     - Position names and zone areas
**** Front 2
     - Force sideline or force middle
**** Middle three
     - Weak side vs middle and strong side
**** Deeps
     - Strong side vs weak side

* Help D principles

** Handler help D

**** Clip (Angelo): 3-handler sag, disc in the middle
     - Sag until stall five, and when to vary that.
     - How far to sag:
       1. All the way into the lane, force the immediate swing.
       2. On edge of lane and jump opportunistically when a
	  cutter becomes open
     - Movement on the swing: Find the downfield target then close
       in and set the mark.

**** Clip (Angelo): Disc with a side handler, not a sideline trap
     - Mark is straight-up
     - Middle defender plays tight and force a difficult reset throw
     - Middle defender can flash opportunistically
     - Far side defender pinches to look for backside opportunities

**** Clip (Angelo): Handler D communication
     - Help on the break side with "I've got around call"
     - Strike switch on a give and go
     - Slide switch on a break side dump.

** Downfield help

**** Clip (Angelo): Flashing and switch from the stack
     - Flash poach from front of stack to force offense to adjust
     - Play with head up looking at your man and cutters, not disc
       to recognize switches early.
     - Make switch calls early and (important) switch only on a
       switch call. If there's no call, stay with your player.

** Straight up D's vs the stack
   - This is how we set-up off a pull or whenever the offense sets up a stack.
   - Even though the set-up is poachy, we match-up once the offense makes their
     cuts, though we can look for switch calls.

*** Purpose of this defense
    - What space/throws we are taking away
    - positioning

**** Clip (Mark): D set up against horizontal
     - Disc with middle handler:
       + Straight up mark with side handler D sag.
       + Middle defenders in stack play in front and pick up any in cutters.
       + Outside defenders pinch in and back and pick up away cutters
       + Can be played with a side force also
     - Disc with side handler:
       + Marker plays straight up and other handlers play help D
       + The two stack defenders near the disc play in front and stick with
	 their O players, even if they cut deep.
       + The far middle D plays front and inside picking up any cuts in toward
	 the disc.
       + Far outside defender plays inside and behind O player prepared to help
	 with deep throws.
     - Examples:
       + Two cutters go deep, one comes across into the space.
       + Diamond pattern cuts

**** Clip (Angelo): Straight up box against the vertical
     - When to run this vs tight man on man
     - Handler defenders play according to the handler help D principles.
     - Front stack defenders set-up in front of and on either side of stack.
     - Two deep defenders play behind and either side of stack
     - Defenders are still matched up against an O player, but are in
       position to switch once their player cuts
     - Call out switches
     - Examples:

* Marking

** Clip (Mark): Sideline trap
   - Marker plays flat while thrower looks upfield.
   - When thrower looks for a reset marker shifts back to take away the dump.
   - Defender only worries about the strike cut or skinny IO.
   - Marker may allow, but still challenge, a straight back dump that stays
     on the sideline.
   - Marker can be signaled to switch to this trap on a "dump" ("Notre Dame", "North Dakota") call.
